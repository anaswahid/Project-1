# 🚗 Car Purchase Amount Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository presents a machine learning project developed in Google Colab to **predict the dollar amount a customer is likely to spend on a car purchase**. The model is built using customer demographic and financial data, making it useful for car dealerships, marketing teams, and financial advisors to anticipate customer spending behavior.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **regression model** that predicts the **car purchase amount** based on a set of input features related to customer demographics and financial status.

## ❓ Problem Statement

You are working as a car salesman and want to develop a predictive model to estimate how much a customer is willing to spend on a car based on the following attributes:

- Customer Name
- Customer E-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary
- Credit Card Debt
- Net Worth

### 📈 Target Variable:
- **Car Purchase Amount**

The objective is to use these input features to predict the most probable dollar amount a customer will spend, enabling better sales strategies and targeted offerings.
