# 📊 Anas_Project_1 – Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

This repository contains a fully interactive data analysis notebook created in Google Colab. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflow using popular Python libraries, focusing on data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete data analysis workflow using Python in a Google Colab environment. It aims to help users understand how to load, clean, explore, and visualize data effectively using industry-standard libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The notebook serves as both an educational tool and a reusable template for future analysis tasks.

## ❓ Problem Statement

This project addresses a real-world scenario of analyzing a structured dataset to extract meaningful insights. The focus is on identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data using visual and statistical techniques.

The notebook helps answer questions such as:
- What are the most frequent categories in the dataset?
- How are numeric variables distributed?
- Are there any outliers or missing data?
- What is the correlation between key variables?
